### Network problem with debian boxes
Some debian boxes have issues when configuring networks. This is a known bug:
https://lists.debian.org/debian-cloud/2017/05/msg00004.html

This can be fixed by specifying the `nic_type` of the vm:
```
debian-vm:
  networks:
    - private_network:
        adapter: 2
        type: dhcp
        nic_type: 82540EM
```
